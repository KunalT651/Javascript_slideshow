# JavaScript Slideshow

A basic vanilla JavaScript slideshow.

## Coding from Scratch

When coding something like a JavaScript slideshow, half of the problem is how to split the lager objective into small steps. Download a copy of the `index.html` and `slideshow.js` files and then follow these steps. Do not proceed to the next step until the current one is done and tested. 

1. Use CSS to place the images on top of each other.
2. Use CSS to hide all the images but the first one.
3. Define a `current` variable to track the current image. Set it to zero.
4. Define a `total` variable to track the number of images. Set it to four.
5. Add a click event to the next button. For now `console.log()` the word "next".
6. When next is clicked. Increase `current` variable by one. Use `console.log()` check.
7. If the `current` variable is too high, reset the variable to zero.
8. Hide all images. Display the next image using the `current` variable.
9. Complete the same steps for the previous button. 
10. Make the slideshow automatically change images every five seconds.
